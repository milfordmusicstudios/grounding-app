PRODUCTIVITY APP — MASTER PROJECT PLAN
(Phase 0 locked · Phase 1 complete · Ready for Phase 2)

==================================================
1. CORE PHILOSOPHY (LOCKED)
==================================================
- Grounding, not pushing
- Progress without guilt
- Planning ≠ obligation
- Awareness ≠ optimization
- Consent before activation
- Completion → renewal (no endless grind)
- Trust over dopamine
- No urgency language
- No shame, no streak punishment
- App supports life; does not demand performance

==================================================
2. CORE OBJECT MODEL (LOCKED)
==================================================

BRAIN DUMP
- Free-form capture
- Never interrupted
- No categorization at entry
- Nothing auto-commits
- No XP

DRAFT ITEMS / CLARIFICATION QUEUE
- Triggered when required info is missing
- Default: one item at a time (optional batch)
- System may suggest: category, type, schedule, difficulty (tasks only)
- User actions: Confirm / Set Aside / Delete
- No XP, no urgency, no counts shown

TASKS
- Require effort
- Scheduled or unscheduled
- Events = tasks with fixed date/time
- Difficulty: Easy / Medium / Hard (default Easy)
- XP earned only on completion

HABITS
- Repeating actions
- Require setup (frequency, skip behavior)
- Static XP per check-in
- No streak pressure
- Missed habits default to skip & move on

PROJECTS
- Group of tasks (minimum 3)
- Completion grants bonus XP or badge
- Started projects may be set aside
- Unstarted projects may be deleted

LOGS (AWARENESS ONLY)
- Factual records (food, mood, notes, cycle, etc.)
- No XP
- Never nag
- Never surface automatically
- Visible only when intentionally viewed or during reviews
- User-defined presets for log types

GOALS (MANTRAS / ASPIRATIONS)
- Identity statements, not targets
- Optional reflections, timeframe, and links
- XP never appears in goal views
- Goals revisited only during reviews

==================================================
3. XP & REWARDS SYSTEM (LOCKED)
==================================================
- XP earned only from task completion and habit check-ins
- No XP for logs, reflections, planning, meals, or groceries
- XP feeds: global lifetime level + category progression
- Visual-only XP (bars/percentages, no numbers)
- Gentle curve, no level cap

BADGES
- Category badges (XP-driven, evolving, lifetime)
- Identity / event badges (no XP)
- Only current evolved form displayed
- Known badges show as silhouettes
- Evolution triggers brief celebration

==================================================
4. CHAPTERS & SEASONS (LOCKED)
==================================================
- Chapters = monthly
- Seasons = quarterly (3 chapters)
- Global level never resets
- Chapter levels reset monthly
- Season 1 focus: participation, consistency, showing up

==================================================
5. HOME & DAILY RULES (LOCKED)
==================================================

HOME
- Grounding, never pushy
- Today snapshot, quick wins, one progress signal
- Meals only if planned for today
- Tier-2 nudges only

DAILY
- Unified task list only
- No popups, nudges, or log prompts
- Interruption-free

==================================================
6. NUDGES SYSTEM (LOCKED)

Tier 2: Recaps, reflections, suggestions (embedded)

- No stacked decisions
- Stability > stimulation
- Animations only for meaning

==================================================
9. BUILD PHASE STATUS
